I passed my final assessment for Flatiron School's Software Engineering program this afternoon.  It's a weird feeling.  It feels oddly anticlimactic - I'm so used to ploughing into the next module after a successful project assessment that I'm now feeling a little bit like: "what do you mean 'there are no more modules left in the course'?  Is that all? I'm I supposed to consider myself a developer now?  These questions are definitely giving me some mixed thoughts.

On one hand I feel like I'm nowhere near being able to consider myself a developer.  I now know that I have just scratched the surface of web development... There is still a small ocean of tech stacks and methodologies out there that simply aren't picked up by Flatiron's curriculum.  The course has opened my eyes to how deep and massive these technologies are, and how powerful they can be when in the hands of people who know how to use them.  I feel almost like a little hatchling: *juuust* strong enough to crack out of my shell, and enter the world of software development.

On the other hand, though,  of course I feel like a developer... look at what I can build now!  I know, I know -  it's only schoolwork, but it nonetheless hints of skills under the surface that hold enormous potential once they're in an environment to grow and mature.  I feel like I'm exactly where Flatiron school told me I'd be at the end of the course: ready to bring real value to the tech industry as an informed and capable junior web developer.

I can see now how the frameworks and toolsets taught in the program can be used in a coordinated manner to build amazing professional-grade products by large companies.  I can also see (and appreciate) how much coordinated man-power must be needed to make these enterprise apps function.  Everything, *everything* needs to be coded, and coded well.  The HR requirements to pull this off in large companies like Uber or Spotify must me gargantuan.  Before Flatiron, hearing something like "Facebook has over 5000 engineers" left me scratching my head.  Now, it totally makes sense: Of course their engineering team is in the thousands, and they're still likely feeling short-staffed!

Learning how code works was really eye-opening.  I had some useless experience with a couple lines of code here-and-there in the past, but it was in the Flatiron program where I really got to understand the full lifecycle of a program's execution.  For the most part this process of 'how code works' was not a real surprise.  What did surprise me the most was how non-negotiable code can be with erroneous or sloppy composition.  You can write a program with a thousand lines of code, and you can receive a fatal error in the program if you have a misplaced `.`.  I find this both fascinating and brutally annoying.  I've grown to really respect code in this regard over the course of the program - it feels a little magical that code can detect the slightest imperfection in how it is articulated, regardless of how large its file is.  I also find it incredible just how *fast* code executes... literally as fast as a speeding electron.  The total number of lines read by the browser & server engines with just a single React component rendering  after a Rails API fetch request is still difficult for me to grasp.


I can honestly say that I wasn't prepared for just how much I was going to learn in this program.   The core competencies I have at the end of my time with Flatiron feel narrow, but deep and quite strong.  Perhaps it is the familiarity I now have with how code works that gives me the strongest takeaway from my studies.  I don't feel like my world in software development  is now set up for just Rails and React alone (although, TBH, that would be AMAZING).  To the contrary, I feel like I'll be almost disappointed if learning other languages & frameworks *isn't* required of me in the near future.  I feel like I'm ready for that challenge, and that's a really wonderful feeling.
